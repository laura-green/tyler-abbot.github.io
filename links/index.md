Here are links to sites I find interesting:

<h1>Finance</h1>
<a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-251" target="_blank">Financial Theory</a> by John Geanakoplos - A great introduction/crash course in finance and its connection to economics and firm decision making.  Required reading/viewing for anyone looking to study finance.

<a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/~ealdrich/" target="_blank">Eric Aldrich's Website</a> - A great speaker about GPU computing, economics, heterogeneous agents, and financial economics.

<h1>Macro</h1>

<a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.fr/" target="_blank">Mainly Macro</a> by Simon Wren Lewis - A great, centrist (in my opinion) view of current macro debates.

<h1>Programming</h1>

<a href="http://python.org" target="_blank">Python.org</a> - Because you should make the change

<a href="http://continuum.io/" target="_blank">Continuum Analytics</a> - An online Python environment that lets you upload programs and work collaboratively with others around the world, as well as edit your own programs in a personalized Python environment from any machine.  Note: Certain institutional firewalls do not allow access to the necessary ports to run the Continuum environment, Sciences Po being one of those institutions.

<a href="http://quant-econ.net/" target="_blank">Quant Econ</a> by Thomas Sargent and John Stachurski - A great introduction to python for economics and scientific computing.  Because Python can do everything Stata, MatLab, Excel, and R can do... combined!

<a href="http://blog.wesmckinney.com/" target="_blank">Wes Mckinney's Blog</a> - A great source for information about Python for data analysis.  He wrote the book on it... literally!

<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EURUSD=X" target="_blank">Because US grad students in France pay the big bucks.</a>
