I am a graduate student in economics at the Institut d'Ã‰tudes Politiques de Paris, or Sciences Po.  My research interests are in macro economics with a focus on financial markets, as well as numerical methods and computational economics/finance.  I am particularly interested in the way that complexity exhibits itself in macroeconomics and how to study emergence using standard modelling tools.
