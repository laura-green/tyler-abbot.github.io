Using LaTeX is mandatory for anyone who needs to type math, but getting the whole thing set-up can be a gigantic pain.  The key to a good install is to get TeX live installed right so that you have a good package manager, then to properly place your packages in the file tree so TexLive can find them.  If you are running Ubuntu or Debian, I suggest following <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1092/how-to-install-vanilla-texlive-on-debian-or-ubuntu/95373#95373" target="_blank"><strong>these</strong></a> super thorough instructions on how to install Tex Live.

Package Management
------------

If you are writing finance papers (or any other economics papers, for that matter) you'll eventually have to put them in a format to match a journal, or you'll just want a nicer format than a standard LaTeX article.  In order to do this, you'll probably need to download some special packages.  When you want to add these custom packages, you should store them in a folder under <code>texmf</code>, in particular I use

{% highlight bash %}
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/tmabbot
{% endhighlight %}

You should store any .sty, .bst, or .cls files you download here for easy reference.  One key thing to remember is to run <code>texhash</code> whenever you are done.  Since I followed the directions in the link in the first paragraph, I have a symbolic link.  Thus I have to type

{% highlight bash %}
sudo /opt/texbin/texhash
{% endhighlight %}

into a terminal.  This will update the packages available in Tex and you should be able to compile your papers.

A great resource for finance paper formatting and a much more thorough introduction to LaTex can be found on Richard Stanton's <a href="http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/stanton/texintro/" target="_blank"><strong>website</strong></a> 

Bibliography Management
--------------

If you tend to use the same references often, you can create one large bibliography file and store it in the file tree so that you don't have to move it from place to place.  I have had a lot of trouble getting my bibliography well placed, so I've come up with a bit of a workaround.  I place my .bib file in any some directory (for me it is called "Writing") and then reference this file in my latex documents using the bibliography command. You simply use 

{% highlight latex %}
\bibliography{/path/to/bibliography}
{% endhighlight %}

instead of just

{% highlight latex %}
\bibliography{}
{% endhighlight %}
