    <p><h5>Heterogeneous Agents and General Equilibrium in Financial Markets</h5> <em>Coming Soon</em></p>
    <p>Abstract:This paper investigates the effects of heterogeneous preferences on risk premia, on asset price dynamics, and on distributions of wealth and consumption. I consider a continuous time economy populated by an arbitrarily large number of agents whose CRRA preferences differ in their risk aversion parameter. I derive closed form expressions for the interest rate, the market price of risk, and drift and diffusion of consumption weights. A closed form expression for asset prices being unattainable, I derive a series representation for the price of a risky stock. I then simulate the economy using a parallelized GPU implimentation of path monte-carlo methods to estimate asset prices and compare the qualitative and quantitative features to real world observations. The model does well in replicating a falling dividend to price ratio over time, low risk free rate, a high risk premium, and rising wealth and consumption gini coefficients.</p>
