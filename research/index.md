    <p><h5>Heterogeneous Agents and General Equilibrium in Financial Markets</h5></p>
    <p>Abstract:This paper investigates the effects of heterogeneous preferences on risk premia, on asset price dynamics, and on distributions of wealth and consumption. I consider a continuous time economy populated by an arbitrarily large number of agents whose CRRA preferences differ in their risk aversion parameter. I derive closed form expressions for the interest rate, the market price of risk, and drift and diffusion of consumption weights. I find that agents dynamically self select into one of three groups depending on their preferences: leveraged investors, diversified investors, and saving divestors. The thresholds for selection are driven by a wedge between the market price of risk and the risk free rate.  I then simulate the economy using a parallelized/GPU implementation of path monte-carlo methods to estimate asset prices and compare the qualitative and quantitative features to real world observations.  The model does well in replicating a falling dividend to price ratio over time, low risk free rate, and rising inequality.  However, changes in the initial condition have non-trivial effects on the short run outcomes of the model, which points towards the need for a more coherent theory of the distribution of risk preference.</p>
